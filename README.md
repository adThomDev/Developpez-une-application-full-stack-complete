### SQL script

An SQL script to populate the database's tables is available at `back/docs/script.sql`

Among other entries, it'll generate domr users accounts, like :

- login: ocruser1@aze.com
- password: ocrMdp1*

### Postman collection

For Postman import the collection

> back/docs/mddapi.postman_collection.json

by following the documentation:

https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting-data/#importing-data-into-postman

# Backend

## Backend technologies

This project was generated with [Java](https://www.java.com/en/) 17 and [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/) 3.4.4

## Setup the database

You can use e.g. [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/fr/) to create a database (name it `ocrp6`, but you can modify that in
the application.properties situated in `back/src/main/ressources`, as well as the credentials that are at the moment
login `userocrp6` and password `mpocrp6`), and admin it with [phpMyAdmin](https://www.phpmyadmin.net/), both of which
are available in the [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/fr/index.html) bundle.
Once the database created, running the API will create the tables if you set `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto` to `create`
in the application.properties file. After it's done you can populate these tables using the sql script found in
`back/docs`.

## Setup the backend API

Clone the project :

> git clone https://github.com/adThomDev/Developpez-une-application-full-stack-complete.git

Go inside the back folder :

> cd back

Install dependencies :

> mvn clean install

Run the API :

> mvn spring-boot:run

# Frontend

## Frontend technologies

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) 18.2.15.,
uses [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) 5.4.5 and the UI library [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/) 18.2.0.

## Setup the frontend server

Go inside the front folder :

> cd front

Install dependencies :

> npm install

Launch the frontend :

> ng serve

The app should then be available at `http://localhost:4200/`
